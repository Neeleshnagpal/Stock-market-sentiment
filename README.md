# 📊 Stock Market Sentiment Analysis using Machine Learning

This project investigates how market sentiment, derived from financial news articles, can influence stock price movements. Using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning, the model aims to classify sentiment and predict short-term stock trends — supporting data-driven investment decisions.
